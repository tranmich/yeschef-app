# 🧠 Debugging Knowledge Base

## 📚 Purpose:
Permanent documentation of debugging solutions and patterns learned.

## 📁 File Structure:
- `issue_YYYYMMDD_{description}.md` - Specific issue solutions
- `pattern_{problem_type}.md` - Recurring problem patterns
- `debugging_toolkit.md` - Useful debugging techniques

## 📋 Template for Issue Documentation:

```markdown
# Issue: [Brief Description]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Severity:** [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
**Component:** [Backend/Frontend/Database/API]

## Problem:
[Detailed description of the issue]

## Root Cause:
[What was actually causing the problem]

## Solution:
[What fixed it]

## Prevention:
[How to avoid this in the future]

## Files Created During Debug:
[List temporary files - all should be deleted]

## Files Modified/Created Permanently:
[List any permanent changes made]
```

## 🎯 Goal:
Build institutional knowledge so we don't repeat debugging sessions for the same issues.
