üß† RECIPE RECOGNITION LOGIC ANALYSIS
====================================

This document analyzes exactly what logic the extractor is missing
compared to human-like recipe recognition capabilities.

CURRENT EXTRACTOR FAILURES:
===========================

1. NO CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING
   ‚ùå Current: Sees "START COOKING!" ‚Üí has cooking keyword ‚Üí must be recipe
   ‚úÖ Should: Sees "START COOKING!" ‚Üí instruction header ‚Üí skip this, look for actual content

2. NO CONTENT VS STRUCTURE DISTINCTION  
   ‚ùå Current: Treats all text equally ‚Üí extracts headers as recipes
   ‚úÖ Should: Understand cookbook organization ‚Üí extract only recipe content

3. NO SEMANTIC VALIDATION
   ‚ùå Current: "PREPARE INGREDIENTS" ‚Üí valid because has "ingredients" keyword
   ‚úÖ Should: "PREPARE INGREDIENTS" ‚Üí instruction to reader, not recipe title

4. NO RECIPE BOUNDARY DETECTION
   ‚ùå Current: Each page = one recipe ‚Üí creates 1000+ fake recipes
   ‚úÖ Should: Multi-page recipe detection ‚Üí creates actual complete recipes

5. NO QUALITY GATES
   ‚ùå Current: If it has measurements ‚Üí must be valid ingredients
   ‚úÖ Should: Validate ingredients make sense for actual cooking

HUMAN-LIKE LOGIC THE EXTRACTOR NEEDS:
=====================================

LAYER 1: STRUCTURAL UNDERSTANDING
- Cookbook sections: TOC, intro, recipes, index
- Recipe organization: title ‚Üí metadata ‚Üí ingredients ‚Üí instructions
- Page flow: recipes span multiple pages, headers repeat

LAYER 2: SEMANTIC VALIDATION  
- Recipe titles describe FOOD, not instructions
- Ingredients are THINGS YOU BUY, with measurements
- Instructions are ACTIONS YOU PERFORM, in sequence
- Metadata is SERVING/TIME info, not content

LAYER 3: CONTEXTUAL REASONING
- "Before you begin" = helpful tip, not recipe data
- "Start Cooking!" = section divider, not recipe title  
- "Page 47" = navigation, not ingredient
- Duplicate text across pages = same recipe, not multiple recipes

LAYER 4: CONTENT FILTERING
- Essential: title, ingredients, instructions
- Optional: servings, time, difficulty, tips
- Discard: headers, page numbers, TOC entries, artifacts

LAYER 5: QUALITY ASSURANCE
- Does this look like something you'd actually cook?
- Are the ingredients real foods with realistic measurements?
- Do the instructions make culinary sense?
- Is this a complete, standalone recipe?

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
=======================

Instead of keyword matching, we need RULE-BASED REASONING:

```python
def extract_recipe_intelligently(page_content):
    # STEP 1: Understand document structure
    page_type = classify_page_type(page_content)
    if page_type in ['toc', 'index', 'intro']:
        return None  # Skip non-recipe pages
    
    # STEP 2: Identify recipe boundaries  
    recipe_blocks = detect_recipe_boundaries(page_content)
    
    for block in recipe_blocks:
        # STEP 3: Extract and validate components
        title = extract_title(block)
        if not is_valid_recipe_title(title):
            continue  # Skip if not actual dish name
        
        ingredients = extract_ingredients(block)
        if not are_valid_ingredients(ingredients):
            continue  # Skip if not real cooking ingredients
        
        instructions = extract_instructions(block)  
        if not are_valid_instructions(instructions):
            continue  # Skip if not actual cooking steps
        
        # STEP 4: Semantic validation
        recipe = {
            'title': title,
            'ingredients': ingredients, 
            'instructions': instructions
        }
        
        if validate_recipe_makes_sense(recipe):
            yield recipe  # Only return recipes that pass ALL checks
```

KEY INSIGHT: COOKBOOK STRUCTURE UNDERSTANDING
============================================

Cookbooks follow predictable patterns:

ATK Teen Format:
```
[RECIPE TITLE]                    ‚Üê Extract this
[DIFFICULTY | SERVES X | TIME]    ‚Üê Extract metadata  
[Educational content]             ‚Üê SKIP this
PREPARE INGREDIENTS               ‚Üê SKIP header
[Actual ingredient list]          ‚Üê Extract this
START COOKING!                    ‚Üê SKIP header  
[Actual instruction steps]        ‚Üê Extract this
```

ATK 25th Anniversary Format:
```
[RECIPE TITLE]                    ‚Üê Extract this
[Educational "Why this works"]    ‚Üê SKIP this
[Ingredient list]                 ‚Üê Extract this
[Numbered instructions]           ‚Üê Extract this
[Page reference footer]           ‚Üê SKIP this
```

The extractor needs to UNDERSTAND these patterns, not just match keywords.

MISSING INTELLIGENCE COMPONENTS:
===============================

1. DOCUMENT STRUCTURE PARSER
   - Recognize cookbook sections and organization
   - Identify recipe vs non-recipe content areas
   - Handle multi-page recipe assembly

2. SEMANTIC CONTENT VALIDATOR
   - Verify recipe titles describe actual dishes
   - Validate ingredients are real foods with measurements
   - Confirm instructions contain cooking actions

3. CONTEXTUAL CONTENT FILTER  
   - Distinguish content from structure
   - Separate essential data from helpful context
   - Remove instructional headers and artifacts

4. RECIPE COMPLETENESS CHECKER
   - Ensure all essential components present
   - Validate recipe makes culinary sense
   - Confirm it's cookable by a human

5. QUALITY ASSURANCE GATES
   - Multiple validation layers
   - Fail-fast on poor quality data
   - Prefer missing recipes over fake recipes

CONCLUSION:
==========

The current extractor uses PATTERN MATCHING where it needs CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING.

It treats cookbooks like raw text documents instead of understanding they are
STRUCTURED INSTRUCTIONAL CONTENT with specific organizational patterns.

We need to rebuild it with COOKBOOK-AWARE INTELLIGENCE that understands:
- What recipes ARE (food preparation instructions)  
- How cookbooks are ORGANIZED (structure vs content)
- What data is ESSENTIAL vs CONTEXTUAL
- How to VALIDATE extracted content makes sense

This requires moving from keyword detection to semantic understanding - 
exactly the kind of reasoning humans use when reading cookbooks.
