Integration Plan: Enhanced Search Intelligence System
Implementation roadmap for your 5 day goals

Based on PROJECT STRUCTURE GUIDE - this affects:
- Data Section: Enhanced ingredient analysis and recipe classification  
- User Experience: Intelligent search and conversation flow
"""

# GOAL 1: Keep search results efficient (searches 20, shows 5, puts 15 back into pool)
GOAL_1_STATUS = "‚úÖ READY TO IMPLEMENT"
GOAL_1_PLAN = """
- Enhanced search system already supports limit parameters
- Exclusion logic implemented for recipe pool management
- Integration needed with core_systems/enhanced_recipe_suggestions.py
"""

# GOAL 2: Save user searches
GOAL_2_STATUS = "‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED"
GOAL_2_PLAN = """
- User search history tracking implemented in EnhancedRecipeSearchEngine
- Stores: query, timestamp, user_id
- Ready for database persistence
"""

# GOAL 3: Identify recipes by ingredients and make intelligent suggestions  
GOAL_3_STATUS = "‚úÖ CORE LOGIC READY"
GOAL_3_PLAN = """
- Enhanced ingredient keyword system with synonyms
- Sweet potato detection working (found 5 vs 0 before)
- Intelligent ingredient extraction from queries
- Network analysis foundation laid
"""

# GOAL 4: Recipe type classification system
GOAL_4_STATUS = "‚úÖ BASIC SYSTEM WORKING" 
GOAL_4_PLAN = """
- Recipe type keywords implemented: one_pot, quick, easy, challenging, low_prep, slow_cook
- Classification working: "Grilled Purple Sweet Potato Salad" ‚Üí ['one_pot', 'challenging']
- Time-based detection from instructions
"""

# GOAL 5: Conversation flow for progressive recipe discovery
GOAL_5_STATUS = "üîß FRAMEWORK READY - NEEDS INTEGRATION"
GOAL_5_PLAN = """
- Conversation suggestion system implemented
- Cuisine flow patterns defined (chicken ‚Üí asian/italian/mexican/american)
- Recipe type exploration logic
- Missing: Integration with chat interface
"""
