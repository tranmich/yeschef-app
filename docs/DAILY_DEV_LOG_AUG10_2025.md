- **dietary**: vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, low-carb, healthy, dairy-free
- **difficulty**: easy, medium, hard (with confidence scoring)
- **cooking_method**: grilled, baked, fried, slow-cooked, one-pot, no-cook
- **season**: spring, summer, fall, winter based on ingredients

### **ATK-Specific Parser (`americas_test_kitchen_universal_parser.py`)**
- Specialized parser for historical ATK format preservation
- 20-chapter categorization system mapping
- "Why This Recipe Works" section extraction
- ATK-optimized multi-page detection patterns

## 🧹 **Project Organization & Cleanup**

### **Main Folder Streamlining:**
- **Archived Legacy Parser**: `universal_cookbook_parser.py` → `archived_temp_files/legacy_parsers/`
- **Archived Test Files**: 3 test files → `archived_temp_files/test_files/`
- **Documentation Organization**: Moved documentation to `docs/` folder
- **Clean Production Structure**: Only essential files remain in main folder

### **Final Main Folder Structure:**
```
