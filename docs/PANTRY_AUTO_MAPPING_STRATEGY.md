# 🧠 Pantry Auto-Mapping Intelligence Strategy
*Revolutionizing Recipe-Ingredient Synchronization for Me Hungie*

## 🎯 Strategic Overview

The Pantry Auto-Mapping System represents the intelligence bridge between raw recipe text and our structured pantry ecosystem. When new recipes are added (via manual entry, scraping, or import), this system automatically maps ingredients to our canonical ingredient library with 90%+ accuracy.

## 🔄 Auto-Mapping Workflow

### **Phase 1: Intelligent Parsing**
```python
# RecipeIngredientProcessor.process_recipe_ingredients()
Raw Ingredient Text → Standardized Ingredient Object
"2 cups of fresh whole milk" → {
    canonical_name: "whole milk",
    amount: 2,
    unit: "cups", 
    modifiers: ["fresh"],
    confidence: 0.95
}
```

### **Phase 2: Canonical Matching**
```python
# IngredientIntelligenceEngine.map_to_canonical()
Standardized Object → Canonical Ingredient Match
{
    canonical_name: "whole milk",
    confidence: 0.95
} → canonical_ingredients.id: 42 (confidence: 0.95)
```

### **Phase 3: Decision Routing**
```sql
-- High Confidence (≥0.85): Auto-map to recipe_ingredients
-- Medium Confidence (0.60-0.84): Queue for review
-- Low Confidence (<0.60): Queue with suggested alternatives
```

## 🧠 Intelligence Engine Components

### **1. IngredientIntelligenceEngine**
```python
class IngredientIntelligenceEngine:
    """Master intelligence for ingredient recognition and mapping"""
    
    def map_ingredient(self, raw_text: str) -> IngredientMapping:
        """
        Core mapping logic with confidence scoring
        - Fuzzy string matching against canonical names
        - Alias recognition (e.g., "AP flour" → "all-purpose flour")
        - Contextual parsing (amounts, units, modifiers)
        - Confidence scoring based on match quality
        """
    
    def learn_from_verification(self, mapping: IngredientMapping, verified_result: int):
        """
        Continuous learning from human verification
        - Update confidence algorithms
        - Add new aliases to canonical ingredients
        - Improve parsing for similar ingredient patterns
        """
```

### **2. RecipeIngredientProcessor**
```python
class RecipeIngredientProcessor:
    """Handles ingredient processing when recipes are added/updated"""
    
    def process_recipe_ingredients(self, recipe_id: int, raw_ingredients: List[str]):
        """
        Main entry point for new recipe ingredient processing
        - Parse each ingredient line
        - Attempt auto-mapping via IngredientIntelligenceEngine
        - Route based on confidence levels
        - Maintain recipe_ingredients table integrity
        """
    
    def queue_uncertain_mapping(self, ingredient_data: dict, suggestions: List[int]):
        """Queue ingredients that need human verification"""
```

### **3. MappingReviewQueue**
```python
class MappingReviewQueue:
    """Simple admin interface for reviewing uncertain mappings"""
    
    def get_pending_reviews(self) -> List[PendingMapping]:
        """Retrieve ingredients awaiting verification"""
    
    def verify_mapping(self, pending_id: int, canonical_id: int):
        """Process human verification and trigger learning"""
```

## 📊 Confidence Scoring Algorithm

### **Scoring Factors:**
```python
confidence_score = weighted_average([
    exact_match_score * 0.4,        # "whole milk" == "whole milk" = 1.0
    fuzzy_match_score * 0.3,        # "AP flour" ≈ "all-purpose flour" = 0.85  
    alias_match_score * 0.2,        # Known aliases from previous mappings
    context_score * 0.1             # Units/amounts make sense for ingredient
])
```

### **Confidence Thresholds:**
- **≥0.85 (High)**: Auto-map immediately (expected 90% of cases)
- **0.60-0.84 (Medium)**: Queue with high-confidence suggestion (expected 5-8% of cases)
- **<0.60 (Low)**: Queue with multiple suggestions or "create new" option (expected 2-5% of cases)

## 🔄 Learning & Improvement System

### **Continuous Intelligence Enhancement:**
```python
# After each human verification:
1. Update fuzzy matching algorithms based on verified patterns
2. Add new aliases to canonical ingredients when appropriate
3. Adjust confidence scoring weights based on success rates
4. Build ingredient context patterns (e.g., baking vs. cooking contexts)
```

### **Data-Driven Improvement:**
```sql
-- Track mapping success rates
-- Identify common false positives/negatives
-- Monitor confidence threshold effectiveness
-- Optimize for minimal human intervention while maintaining accuracy
```
