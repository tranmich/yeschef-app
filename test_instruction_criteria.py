2. Cook bacon in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until bacon just begins to brown and most of fat has rendered, about 4 minutes. Transfer to small bowl lined with strainer; discard bacon and add 1 tablespoon fat back to skillet. Increase heat to medium-high; add onion, jalape√±o, and cumin; and cook until softened and just starting to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Reduce heat to medium, stir in pureed beans, and cook until thick and creamy, 4 to 6 minutes. Off heat, stir in cilantro and lime juice."""
